# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
I decided to use a marker because I know that markers are thick enough to fit in the hole in the middle of the finch robot. I used a multitude of different markers until I found the marker size that fits best. I also specifically chose purple because it is my favorite color. Initially I was going to spell out 'hello world', however, after realizing the difficulty of making the words legible, I settled on a shortened version: 'HI'.

## Challenges faced and solutions
During the first half of my assignment I was unable to get my Finch robot to move at all. I tried several different strategies to get my robot to respond to my code and none of it workd. Only until one of my peers looked at my computer was I able to get my robot to move after realizing that the code had autosave turned off. After that, I used the normal code-debugging procedures I had been applying all year
## Future Enhancements
Given more time to work on this robot I would have created an exponentially more complex algorithm in which I could get the FInch robot to write any word on any size piece of paper. This more complex algorithm could also incorporate user input (size of paper and word to write). I think based off of the concepts we worked on in this class this would not be a difficult feature to add.
